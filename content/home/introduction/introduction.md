# Introduction
We collect driver behavior data on four different types of buses. We have 55 participants, including 15 female drivers and 40 male drivers. 
To ensure the diversity of our dataset, we select the participants with different body heights, weights and different driving styles, wearing different uniforms, 
masks or sunglasses. Each driver is instructed to perform 10 abnormal and 1 normal driver behaviors,
including Normal Driving, Drinking, Eating, Calling, Playing Phone, Turn Around, Tidying Hair, One-handed Driving, Pulling Driver, Grabbing Steering Wheel, Yawning.
The drivers are also instructed to perform the behavior in different styles. For example, the driver can perform the calling behavior with either his left or right hand.
More critically, we collect our dataset from day to night with different lighting conditions to simulate the real-world driving environment.
For each video, we annotate the starting and ending frames of each action instance.
